            <h2>How many copper atoms are in a bronze guitar string?</h2>
            <p>The string we are finding the mass for is the 6th string, which is the heaviest string on a guitar. 
            Most bronze has 88% copper (Cu) along with 12% tin (Sn). The mass of a 6th string for a guitar is 5.21 grams. 
            What this means is that copper takes up 4.5848 grams of the 5.21 grams of bronze. The molar mass
            of copper is 63.546 which means that the amount of copper in a bronze guitar string is
            0.07214930916 moles. The way I figured this out is I took 4.5848 grams and divided it by the 
            molar mass of copper and got ~0.07 moles. I took the number of moles of copper in the guitar string 
            and multiplied it by 6.02*10^23 which is equivalent to 1 mole and ended up with 4.34*10^22. Here is
            a visual representation of my math.</p>
