            <h2>How much tin is in a bronze guitar string?</h2>
            <p>Tin (Sn) is 12% of a bronze guitar string, and a bronze guitar string (6th string)
            is 5.21 grams. This means that the amount of tin in this guitar string is 0.6252 grams
            or that the amount of moles of tin is 0.0052661612 in a guitar string. I figured this 
            out by multiplying the grams of a guitar string by 0.12 to figure out the amount of tin
            in a guitar string and then proceeded to divide the amount of tin in a guitar string by 
            the molar mass of tin (118.71 grams) which got me 0.0052661612 moles. To figure out the 
            amount of tin atoms of tin in the guitar string, I had to take the number of tin moles and 
            multiply it by 6.02*10^23 which is the amount of atoms inside one whole mole. This led me to 
            the conclusion that there are 3.17*10^21 atoms of tin in a bronze guitar string. Here is a 
            visual representation of my math.</p>
