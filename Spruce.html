            <h2>How many carbon atoms are inside of a spruce wood body of a guitar?</h2>
            <p>There are many different types of wood that are used for the body of a guitar.
            To make this project easier, I decided to specifically research spruce wood since
            that is the most popular type of wood used for acoustic guitars. Spruce wood is comprised
            of 39.5% cellulose (C6H10O5), 17.2% Glucomannan (C24H42O21), 10.4% Glucuronoxylan, 3% of other polysaccharides,
            27.5% lignin (C9H10O2,C10H12O3,C11H14O4, for this experiment I used C30H36O9), and 2.1% of total extractives. 
            The spruce wood top of a guitar is around 110 grams, which means that cellulose would 
            take up 43.45 grams, glucomannan would take up 18.92 grams, glucuronoxylan would take up 11.44 grams, 
            other polysaccharides would take up 3.96 grams, lignin would take up 30.25 grams, and the total 
            extractives would take up 2.31 grams. Carbon is 44.44549977% of cellulose, 43.244292248% of glucomannan, 
            and 66.651875733% of lignin, which means that there is a total of 47.6555821526 grams of carbon in a spruce top 
            to a guitar. To figure out the amount of moles, I divided the grams of carbon by the molar mass of carbon (12.0107) 
            and ended up with 3.96776059285 moles of carbon. To figure out how many atoms of carbon there were, I had to 
            multiply the number of moles of carbon in the spruce top with the number of atoms in a mole (6.02*10^23) and 
            ended up with approximately 2.39*10^24 atoms of carbon on a spruce top of a guitar. Here is a visual representation of 
            my math.</p>
